## Review Criteria & Process:
* Our review team will review all submitted abstracts for appropriateness and the all-important "wow" factor.
* All CFP submissions will be rated and ranked according to score, and then the first round of acceptance notices will be issued.
* In the event, that a speaker is selected but does not reply to confirm they can attend after a few days the next ranked speaker will be offered instead.
* We reserve the right to select presentations and/or presenters beyond the submitted proposals.
Our review team assesses each proposal on three main areas:
* Topic: We prioritize topics that are relevant, timely, and offer new insights or address current challenges in the security field.
* Content: Proposals should be clear, well-organized, and have a focused message with practical takeaways for attendees.
* A Vibrant Speaker Community: We aim to select a mix of local community speakers and speakers from outside our region. To enable some of our local experts in presenting, maybe for the first time.
